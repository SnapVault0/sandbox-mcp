# 🚀 SandboxMCP (SMCP)

An open-source framework for seamlessly integrating local LLMs with Model Context Protocol, providing a Claude-like development experience without dependencies on proprietary services.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Local-First**: Run everything locally - perfect for air-gapped environments or privacy-conscious users
- **Claude-Like Experience**: Familiar interface and workflow similar to Claude Desktop
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend with new LLM backends and MCP servers
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built with security and scalability in mind
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation with excellent IDE support

## 🎯 Why SMCP?

SMCP was created to democratize the Claude-like development experience. It enables developers to:

- Use local LLMs in environments where cloud services are restricted
- Create custom development environments with their preferred LLM
- Integrate existing open-source MCP servers or build custom ones
- Maintain full control over their data and infrastructure
